# 🐍 42 Python Algorithms & Systems Projects

This repository showcases Python reimplementations of classic algorithmic and systems-level projects originally developed in C during coding journey.
Each mini-project demonstrates how core programming concepts translate from low-level C to Python—and highlights how higher-level languages empower automation, troubleshooting, and scripting in a DevOps context.

---

## Why This Repo?

- **Bridging the gap:** From C to Python, showing how systems knowledge accelerates scripting and automation skills.
- **Learning in public:** Open reflections on what changes (and what doesn’t) when switching languages.

## How to Use

Clone the repo, navigate to any completed project folder, and follow the instructions in its README.  
All scripts have a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) and are executable, so you can run them directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yahyaeb/algo-42-python.git
cd algo-42-python/get_next_line
./get_next_line.py
